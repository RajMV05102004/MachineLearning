🏏 T20 Cricket Score Predictor

A machine learning model that predicts the final score of a T20 cricket innings based on current match conditions such as batting team, bowling team, overs completed, runs scored, wickets lost, and recent performance.

📘 Project Overview

This project uses historical T20 match data to build a regression model that can estimate how many runs a team will likely score by the end of their innings.

🧠 Problem Statement

Given the following inputs during a T20 match:
- Batting team
- Bowling team
- Overs completed
- Current score
- Wickets fallen
- Runs scored in the last 5 overs

Predict the final score at the end of the 20 overs.

📂 Dataset

The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed from real-world T20 match data. Key features used include:
- `batting_team`
- `bowling_team`
- `current_score`
- `balls_left`
- `wickets_left`
- `current_run_rate`
- `last_five_overs_runs`

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost– for machine learning
- Pickle – for saving the model pipeline
- Streamlit– for deploying the web app

📊 Model Details

The pipeline uses:
- OneHotEncoding for categorical features (`batting_team`, `bowling_team`)
- ThreeLayered Stacking Regressor as the final model, using a combination of Random Forest and XGBoost models in layers

🎯 Evaluation Metric

- The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Achieved low error with consistent predictions for different match scenarios.
